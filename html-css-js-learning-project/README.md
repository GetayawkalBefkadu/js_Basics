- **index.html**: The main HTML document that structures the content of the web page. It includes a header, a section for comments, and links to the CSS and JavaScript files.
  
- **style.css**: This file contains the styles for the HTML elements. It defines the appearance of the page, including layout, colors, fonts, and spacing.
  
- **script.js**: This file contains the JavaScript code that adds interactivity to the web page. It handles user input, updates the DOM, and manages the comment section functionality.
